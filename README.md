## Simple tic-tac-toe game

#### As part of preparations for my Java bootcamp I was asked complete a simple tic-tac-toe game.

The application lets you play tic-tac-toe for 1 or 2 players.

The software has a simple logic which maps the game board into a 2 dimensional table and compares the status of the board with a set of win conditions.

The game comes from a course on Udacity. *I worte only the game conditions part of the logic.*
